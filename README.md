# 📐 Volumes of Solids

A visual math playground exploring volume, surface area, and solid shapes through code.

This project is part of my broader journey to **level up in linear algebra, vector math, matrix operations, and calculus** — skills that power advanced game physics, animation, and simulation. I'm building up visual intuition and hands-on knowledge by writing code that draws, transforms, and deconstructs 3D solids from the ground up.

## 🧠 Goals

- Understand how **calculus describes volume** via integration and rotation
- Practice **matrix transformations** in 2D/3D space
- Visualize **vector fields, cross products, and projections**
- Build a solid foundation for **future game physics engines** and visual tools

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- (Optional: Plotly or Pygame for interactive extensions)

---

## 🚧 Status

This project is a **work in progress** — expect experiments, tweaks, and new visualizations over time.
